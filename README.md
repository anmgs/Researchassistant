Yes ✅ — you can absolutely update the README anytime after creating the repository.
You just edit the file locally (or directly on GitHub) and push the changes.

Here’s the updated README with an **example output screenshot** section so your repo looks more polished:

# 🧠 Research Assistant

An AI-powered research paper summarizer that fetches papers from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), processes them using the OpenAI API, and displays concise summaries through an interactive [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) interface.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 Search for research papers by keyword from arXiv.
- 📝 Summarize abstracts and key points using OpenAI's GPT models.
- 💻 Easy-to-use Gradio web interface.
- 📚 Ideal for quickly understanding large volumes of academic content.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Packages:
  - `openai`
  - `arxiv`
  - `gradio`

## 📦 Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Researchassistant.git
   cd Researchassistant
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(Or run the first cells of the notebook to auto-install them.)*

3. Set your OpenAI API key:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```

   *(Windows PowerShell: `setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"`)*

## ▶️ Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Researchassistant.ipynb
   ```
2. Run all cells.
3. Enter a research topic in the Gradio interface to view fetched papers and AI-generated summaries.

## 📸 Example

**Input:**

```
Topic: Large Language Models
```

**Output:**

```
1. Title: Scaling Laws for Large Language Models
   Summary: This paper explores how performance scales with model size, dataset size, and training compute, offering insights into optimal scaling strategies for LLMs.

2. Title: Instruction Tuning for Large Language Models
   Summary: The authors propose instruction tuning methods to improve LLM performance on zero-shot and few-shot tasks.
```

Once you have your repo, just take a screenshot of the Gradio interface when it’s running, save it as `output_screenshot.png` in the repo folder, and it will show up in the README.  

If you want, I can also make you a **prettier version** with emojis and section dividers so it looks more like a polished GitHub project. That can help get more attention when people visit your repo.
